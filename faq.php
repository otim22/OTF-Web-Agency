                                        <div class="desc">Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that 
										design and development should respond to the user’s behaviour and environment 
										based on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a 
										mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media 
										queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should 
										automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting 
										abilities. The website will have the technology to automatically respond to 
										the user’s preferences. This will eliminate the need for a different design 
										and development phase for each new gadget on the market.</div>

                                        <div class="desc">Think of it this way. When you’re looking for an apartment to stay, you most likely start by 
										searching for adverts. You find a few apartments in your area and decide to ask about interior, compound 
										and pricing. Once you’ve decided which kind of apartment you’re looking for, you drive over for a look around.</div>
										
										<div class="desc">What happens when you get to apartment but it looks run down? One that has 
										obvious signs of neglect? One that looks as though the owner should have it Renovated? If you’re like most people… 
										you keep on driving!</div>
										
										<div class="desc">Why ? Are you afraid to leave in search run down house? Do you 
										think the owners are negligent? You don’t know these people, but from the image they portray… you are suspicious 
										and skeptical.</div>
										
										<div class="desc">The same thing applies to your Web design. When visitors come to your Web site, they are either 
										rolling their eyes with smiles.</div>
										
										<div class="desc">In many cases, your Web site is your business. It is the image you present to the Internet world. 
										We also know that there is a lot going on behind the scenes that contributes to your site functioning properly. A 
										professionally designed Web site will give your business the foundation it needs to succeed by using the latest 
										technologies and design applications, by being search engine compatible and by displaying correctly in a variety of 
										browsers. When you hire OTF web agency, you get the skills, knowledge and expertise that only comes from years of hands-on 
										experience.</div>
